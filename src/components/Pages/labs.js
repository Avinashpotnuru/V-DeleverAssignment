            <p className="lab-description">
            This test measures the amount of acetaminophen in the blood. Acetaminophen is one of the most 
            common medicines used in over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers. It is found in more than
             200 brand name medicines. These include Tylenol, Excedrin, Nyquil, and Paracetamol, which is commonly
              found outside the U. S. Acetaminophen is safe and effective
             when taken at the proper dose. But an overdose can cause serious and sometimes deadly liver damage.

            Hearing Tests for Children
            </h1>
            <p className="lab-description">
            These tests measure how well your child is able to hear. 
            Although hearing loss can occur at any age, hearing problems in infancy 
            and early childhood can have serious consequences. That's because normal
             hearing is essential for language development in babies and toddlers.
              Even a temporary hearing loss can make it harder for a child to understand
               spoken language and learn to speak.Normal hearing happens when sound waves
                travel into your ear, causing your eardrum to vibrate. The vibration moves 
                the waves farther into the ear, where it triggers nerve cells to send sound
                 information to your brain. This information is translated into the sounds you hear.

            Skin Cancer Screening
            </h1>
            <p className="lab-description">
            A skin cancer screening is a visual exam of the skin that can be done by yourself
             or a health care provider. The screening checks the skin for moles, birthmarks,
              or other marks that are unusual in color, size, shape, or texture. Certain unusual
               marks may be signs of skin cancer.Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer
                in the United States. The most common types of skin cancer are basal cell and 
                squamous cell cancers. These cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body 
                and are usually curable with treatment. A third type of skin cancer is called
                 melanoma. Melanoma is less common than the other two, but more dangerous because
                  it's more likely to spread. Most skin cancer deaths are caused by melanoma.
                  A skin cancer screening can help find cancer in its earlier stages when it's easier to treat.

            <p className="lab-description">
            This test measures the level of thyroid antibodies in your blood.
             The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located near the throat.
              Your thyroid makes hormones that regulate the way your body uses energy
              . It also plays an important role in regulating your weight, body temperature
              , muscle strength, and even your mood.Antibodies are proteins made by the immune 
              system to fight foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. But sometimes antibodies
               attack the body's own cells, tissues, and organs by mistake. This is known as 
               an autoimmune response. When thyroid antibodies attack healthy thyroid cells,
                it can lead to an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid. These disorders can
                 cause serious health problems if not treated.
